Welcome to my site [YosephSA.com](https://www.yosephsa.com). I am very fortunate to work with cutting edge technologies as well as older technology that can be considered the back bone of our modern software infrastructure. It'd only be a shame to not share my experiences along with the hurdles I run into. I am still early in my career and have a lot to share as I learn more and expand my expertise. This website is medium for me to share that with you in hopes to give back to the community as well as hear from you on different areas I can improve on.


### A little bit about myself:

I am a Software Engineer at C&nbsp;Spire working mainly on the Web side (both FE and BE), as well as on the DevOps. I am most interested in automating development processes as well as making secure, elegant, obvious to use, and stable APIs exposed to the world wide web.

I am also a man of many interests, I find joy in picking up new hobbies and learning them from the ground up. I find it important to regularly make youself learn something completely new and push through that feeling of noviceness, otherwise we become complacent.

I used to be an avid cyclist (both road and mountain), and a competative fencer; however, these days I mainly rock climb, and study classical guitar. 

### Looking forward:

All in all, I am excited for what is to come with this new website. I plan to post about software technologies, incidents, and concepts that I find fascinating as I go. I may also post about other topics unrelated to software, but I plan to have non software posts be seperated in some way as to keep the software side the focus. 

That said, this is meant to evolve and expand as needed. This is after all following a journey. I look forward to what is to come!

Thank you,

Yoseph Alabdulwahab
